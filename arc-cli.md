# Arc Command Line Tool

In the vein of Laravel's `artisan` command line tool, Arc comes with it's own command line tool. "Arcisan" didn't have the
same ring to it, so we just called it `arc`.

## Commands

### `php arc:ship`

Preparing your plugin for deployment to an actual Wordpress site can be annoying and time consuming. That's why we've 
prepared a command for quickly turning your plugin into a .zip file ready to deploy.

Just type `php arc:ship` and relax while the work is done for you.
